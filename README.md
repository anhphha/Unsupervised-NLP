# Unsupervised-NLP

Arcada UAS | Project: Unsupervised NLP | Tools: Python | Score: 4.0/5.0 | Project is about to analyze and compare the performance between tf-idf and word2vec feature extraction with different parameters and amount of training data
- Built NLP (text) data analysis by using tf-idf and word2vec, tested different parameters, decreased/ increased the training data sizes and evaluated the results
- Compared the performance of each feature extraction (tf-idf, word2vec), parameter and training data size
